### Key Instrumented Operations

| Operation | Span Name | Tags | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|------|---------|
| Device Connection | `Connect to Bluetooth Device` | device_name, device_type, signal_strength | Track connection success/failure rates |
| Audio Playback | `Audio Playback` | track_title, track_artist, device_name | Monitor playback reliability |
| Track Navigation | `Skip to Next Track` | track_index, skip_result | Measure user engagement patterns |
| Volume Adjustment | `audio.volume` | volume_level | Track user interaction frequency |
| EQ Changes | `Apply EQ Preset` | preset_name, bass_setting, treble_setting | Monitor feature usage |

## üéÆ Demo Scenarios

This app simulates **two critical user workflows** identified through research of real-world Bluetooth audio control apps:

### 1. **Device Discovery and Pairing Flow** üîç
*Critical Success Factor: Seamless device identification and connection*

**User Journey:**
- Tap "Devices" tab ‚Üí Scan for available Bluetooth speakers
- Review device list with signal strength and battery info
- Select target device (e.g., "JBL Flip 5" or "Sony SRS-XB43") 
- Monitor connection progress and handle failures gracefully

**Sentry Metrics Captured:**
- Device scan duration and success rates
- Connection attempt outcomes by device type
- User abandonment points during pairing
- Error context for failed connections

**Technical Implementation:**
- `bt.scan` transaction for device discovery
- `bt.connection` transaction with detailed timing
- Custom metrics: `bluetooth.connection.success/failure`
- Success criteria: Connection latency < 3 seconds

### 2. **Active Audio Control and Session Management** üéµ  
*Critical Success Factor: Responsive controls and session continuity*

**User Journey:**
- Navigate to "Now Playing" ‚Üí Control active audio session
- Test core controls: play/pause, skip tracks, volume adjustment
- Experiment with EQ settings and audio preferences  
- Switch between playlists and maintain session state

**Sentry Metrics Captured:**
- User interaction response times (< 50ms UI blocking requirement)
- Audio control success/failure rates
- Session duration and engagement patterns
- Feature usage analytics (EQ presets, skip frequency)

**Technical Implementation:**
- `ui.action.remoteControl` spans for all user interactions
- `bt.write.command` spans (< 120ms RTT requirement)
- `device.response` child spans (ACK < 250ms requirement)
- `ui.state.render` spans (< 16ms frame requirement)

### 3. **Error Recovery and Edge Cases** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Simulate connection timeouts and recovery
- Test app crash scenarios with automatic restart
- Handle audio playback interruptions

## üìä Technical Instrumentation

### BLE Command Flow (Following Bluetooth Stack Layers)
```
User Gesture ‚Üí Mobile App (Swift/Sentry) ‚Üí BLE Stack ‚Üí Device ACK ‚Üí UI Update
     |              |                         |            |         |
 < 50ms      ui.action.remoteControl    bt.write.command  device.response  ui.state.render
                                            < 120ms         < 250ms      < 16ms
```

### App Launch Performance Tracking (TTID/TTFD)

The app implements comprehensive app launch performance monitoring with both **Time to Initial Display (TTID)** and **Time to Full Display (TTFD)** tracking:

```swift
// TTID - When UI becomes visible
let ttidSpan = appLaunchSpan.startChild(operation: "app.launch.ttid", description: "Time to Initial Display")
// ... UI setup ...
ttidSpan.setTag(value: "completed", key: "ttid_status")
ttidSpan.finish()

// TTFD - When app becomes fully interactive
let ttfdSpan = appLaunchSpan.startChild(operation: "app.launch.ttfd", description: "Time to Full Display")
// ... full initialization ...
ttfdSpan.setTag(value: "interactive", key: "ttfd_status")
ttfdSpan.finish()

// Report TTFD to Sentry for enableTimeToFullDisplayTracking compliance
SentrySDK.reportFullyDisplayed()
```

**TTFD Compliance Strategy:**
- **Custom Spans**: Detailed timing with business context and tags
- **Sentry Native Call**: `SentrySDK.reportFullyDisplayed()` for automatic SDK integration
- **Dual Approach**: Comprehensive tracking + native Sentry Mobile Vitals compatibility

### Custom Span Metrics
| Span Operation | Success Criteria | Failure Signals | Business Value |
|----------------|------------------|------------------|----------------|
| `app.launch.ttid` | < 1000ms | slow UI render | First impression |
| `app.launch.ttfd` | < 2000ms | delayed interactivity | User engagement |
| `ui.action.remoteControl` | < 50ms blocking | ANR, frame drops | User retention |
| `bt.write.command` | < 120ms RTT | timeout, retry | Device compatibility |
| `device.response` | ACK < 250ms | no ACK, error code | Connection quality |
| `ui.state.render` | < 16ms frame | stale UI, mismatch | Perceived performance |

### Dashboard Metrics Available
- **Connection Success Rate**: `bluetooth.connection.success` vs `bluetooth.connection.failure`
- **Command Latency**: `command.latency_ms` distribution by device type
- **UI Responsiveness**: `ui.action.latency_ms` by control type
- **Feature Usage**: `eq.preset.applied`, `track.skip` counters
- **Session Health**: Connection duration, error rates by signal strength

## üìà Building Dashboards

### Suggested Queries for Sentry Dashboards

```sql
-- Time to Initial Display metrics
SELECT 
    avg(duration) as avg_ttid_ms,
    p95(duration) as p95_ttid_ms
FROM spans
WHERE op = 'app.launch.ttid'

-- Time to Full Display metrics  
SELECT 
    avg(duration) as avg_ttfd_ms,
    p95(duration) as p95_ttfd_ms
FROM spans
WHERE op = 'app.launch.ttfd'
```

#### Connection Success Rate
```sql
SELECT 
    count_if(tags[connection_result] = 'success') / count() as success_rate
FROM transactions
WHERE transaction = 'Connect to Bluetooth Device'
```

#### Audio Playback Performance
```sql
SELECT 
    avg(duration) as avg_playback_start_time,
    p95(duration) as p95_playback_start_time
FROM transactions
WHERE transaction = 'Audio Playback'
```

#### User Engagement Metrics
```sql
SELECT 
    tags[device_type],
    count() as connection_attempts,
    avg(duration) as avg_connection_time
FROM transactions
WHERE transaction LIKE '%bluetooth%'
GROUP BY tags[device_type]
```

#### Feature Usage Tracking

SELECT 
    tags[preset_name],
    count() as usage_count
FROM transactions
WHERE transaction = 'Apply EQ Preset'
GROUP BY tags[preset_name]
ORDER BY usage_count DESC
```

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Custom Error Context

The app automatically enriches errors with contextual information:

```swift
scope.setContext(key: "app_state", value: [
    "connected_device": bluetoothService.connectedDevice?.name ?? "None",
    "current_track": audioPlayer.currentTrack?.title ?? "None",
    "playback_state": audioPlayer.playbackState.rawValue,
    "volume": audioPlayer.audioSettings.volume
])
```

### Performance Profiling

Capture visual user sessions for debugging with privacy protection:

```swift
// Session Replay with Privacy Controls
options.experimental.sessionReplay.sessionSampleRate = 1.0 // 100% for demo
options.experimental.sessionReplay.onErrorSampleRate = 1.0 // Capture on all errors
options.experimental.sessionReplay.maskAllText = true // Redact all text content
options.experimental.sessionReplay.maskAllImages = true // Redact all images
```

**Privacy Features:**
- All text content is automatically masked with asterisks
- All images are redacted with colored blocks
- User input is never captured in plain text
- View hierarchy structure is preserved for debugging context

**How to View Session Replays:**
1. Navigate to your Sentry project ‚Üí **Replays** section
2. Click on any session to watch the video playback

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No Sentry Data Appearing**:
   - Verify DSN is correctly set in `AppDelegate.swift`
   - Check network connectivity
   - Ensure debug mode is enabled: `options.debug = true`

2. **Performance Data Missing**:
   - Confirm `tracesSampleRate = 1.0` for testing
   - Check that automatic instrumentation is enabled
   - Verify transactions are properly finished

3. **Simulator vs Device**:
   - Some features (like Session Replay) work better on physical devices
   - Bluetooth simulation is more realistic on device

4. **MetricKit Issues**:
   - If the app crashes during startup with MetricKit enabled, disable it temporarily:
   ```swift
   // Temporarily disable MetricKit if causing issues
   // options.enableMetricKit = true
   ```
   - MetricKit requires iOS 13.0+ and may have compatibility issues with certain simulators
   - Check Console.app for MetricKit-related error messages

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging for troubleshooting:

```swift
options.debug = true
options.logLevel = .debug
```

### iOS Version Compatibility

If you encounter issues with specific Sentry features, ensure your iOS version meets the requirements:
- **iOS 14.0+** for general functionality and Session Replay
- **iOS 13.0+** for MetricKit integration 
- **iOS 14.0+** for WatchdogTerminationTracking
- **iOS 18.5+** recommended for optimal SwiftUI compatibility in simulator

## üé≠ Demo Performance Issues (For Sentry Dashboard Testing)

### üö® Artificially Poor Performance Scenarios

To demonstrate how Sentry captures and visualizes performance issues, the app includes subtle performance problems for specific devices. **These issues are designed to be discovered through metrics analysis rather than obvious indicators.**

#### **Scenario 1: Connection Success Rate Below 85%**
- **Target Device:** "Bedroom Move" (Portable speaker)
  - **Success Rate:** 40% (Will fail 6 out of 10 attempts)
  - **Discovery Method:** Low success rate visible in connection dashboards

- **Secondary Device:** "Basement Sub" (Subwoofer)
  - **Success Rate:** 70% (Will fail 3 out of 10 attempts)  
  - **Discovery Method:** Higher failure rate compared to other devices

#### **Scenario 2: Laggy Audio Controls**
- **Target Devices:** "Basement Sub" & "Kitchen One"
- **Affected Controls:**
  - **Skip Next:** 150ms delay (vs 20ms normal)
  - **Skip Previous:** 180ms delay (vs 25ms normal)
  - **Shuffle Playlist:** 250ms delay (vs 30ms normal)
- **Discovery Method:** High P95 latency times in performance dashboards

#### **Expected Dashboard Results:**
1. **Connection Success Rate:** Will show ~75% overall (below 85% threshold)
2. **Audio Control P95 Latency:** Will show >100ms for problematic devices
3. **Device Breakdown:** Clear performance differences by device name

### üìä Demo Script for Presentations

**Step 1: Show Baseline Performance**
1. Connect to "Living Room Arc" or "Office Era 100" 
2. Use audio controls ‚Üí Should show normal performance (~20-30ms)
3. **Discovery:** "Notice how responsive these controls feel"

**Step 2: Demonstrate Connection Issues** 
1. Try connecting to "Bedroom Move" multiple times
2. **Discovery:** "Hmm, this device seems to fail a lot"
3. Show Sentry dashboard ‚Üí "Let's check our metrics to see what's happening"
4. Point out success rate drops below 85%

**Step 3: Demonstrate Laggy Controls**
1. Connect to "Basement Sub" 
2. Use skip/shuffle controls ‚Üí "These controls feel sluggish"
3. **Discovery:** "Let's investigate the performance data"
4. Show Sentry dashboard ‚Üí P95 latency >150ms for these devices

**Step 4: Root Cause Analysis**
1. Open Trace Explorer ‚Üí Filter by `device_name:"Basement Sub"`
2. Show span durations ‚Üí "Look at these timing differences"
3. **Discovery:** "We can see certain devices consistently perform worse"
4. Correlate with device metadata and usage patterns

### üéØ Sentry Query Examples for Demo

```sql
-- Discover connection issues by examining success rates
SELECT 
    tags[device_name],
    count_if(tags[connection_result] = 'failure') / count() * 100 as failure_rate
FROM spans
WHERE span.op = 'bt.connection'
GROUP BY tags[device_name]
ORDER BY failure_rate DESC

-- Investigate audio control performance by device  
SELECT 
    tags[device_name],
    tags[control_type],
    percentile(span.duration, 0.95) as p95_latency_ms,
    avg(span.duration) as avg_latency_ms
FROM spans  
WHERE span.op = 'ui.action.remoteControl'
GROUP BY tags[device_name], tags[control_type]
ORDER BY p95_latency_ms DESC
```

### üîß Reverting Demo Issues

To return to normal performance, modify these values in the code:

**BluetoothService.swift** (Line ~90):
```swift
// Change back to normal 95% success rate for all devices
let willSucceed = Double.random(in: 0...1) > 0.05
```

**AudioPlayerService.swift** (Lines ~210, ~260, ~480):
```swift  
// Remove device-specific delays, set all to normal:
artificialDelay = 0.02 // Normal delay for all devices
```

### üí° **Key Demo Philosophy**

The performance issues are **subtle and realistic** - developers discover problems through:
- **Metrics Analysis:** High latency, low success rates
- **Comparative Data:** Some devices perform worse than others  
- **User Experience:** Noticeable lag during actual usage
- **Trend Investigation:** Patterns emerge through dashboard analysis

**No obvious "demo" or "artificial" tags** - issues are discovered the same way real performance problems would be found in production.
